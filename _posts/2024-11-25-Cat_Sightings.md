I cannot remember a time when I did not stop to observe and pet an outside cat.

The pictures above and below are of two different cats. The one above would greet me on my evening walks while I was living in Los Alamos. He was affectionate and gregarious, a possible consequence of residing in a bed of catnip. The cat below is also an outdoor cat that favors my current neighborhood in Seattle. He is called Goose by my friends. He never allows me pet him, yet his gaze will settle on me then slip away: I think him too evasive for such a happy name.

The cat below seemed lonely. I wanted to rescue this one when we met. My landlord has a strict ban on pets.
