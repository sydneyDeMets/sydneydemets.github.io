Je ne me souviens pas d’un temps quand j’ai vu un chat et je n’ai pas arrêté pour lui regarder.

The cats above and below are two different cats. The one pictured above would greet me on my evening walks while I was living in Los Alamos. The cat in question was affectionate and gregarious, a possible consequence of residing in a bed of catnip. The cat below is also an outdoor cat that favors my neighborhood. He is called Goose by my friends. He never lets me pet him and lets his gaze settle on me then slip away: I think him too evasive for a blunt and happy name.

The cat below seemed lonely. I wanted to rescue this one when we met. Normal cats at most let you pet them then return to their own lives. They are always the ones to call it quits on encounters. This cat didn't want to leave me. My landlord has a strict ban on pets.
