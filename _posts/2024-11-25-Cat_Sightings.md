Je ne me souviens pas d’un temps quand j’ai vu un chat et je n’ai pas arrêté pour lui regarder.

The pictures above and below are of two different cats. The one above would greet me on my evening walks while I was living in Los Alamos. He was affectionate and gregarious, a possible consequence of residing in a bed of catnip. The cat below is also an outdoor cat that favors my current neighborhood in Seattle. He is called Goose by my friends. He never allows me pet him, yet his gaze settles on me then slips away: I think him too evasive for such a blunt and happy name.

The cat below seemed lonely. I wanted to rescue this one when we met. At most, cats let you pet them then return to their own lives. In my life, cats have almost always dictated the length of our encounters. This cat didn't want to leave me. My landlord has a strict ban on pets.
