# About me:

- *Full name:* Sydney DeMets
- *Current location:* Seattle, WA
- *Professionally:* PhD candidate in Information Science. I research the ways that medium alters the diffusion of false, unverified, and misleading information using methods from computational social science and social networks analysis. I find many strains of false, unverified, and misleading information interesting, yet I am most compelled by rumors in crisis events. 
- *Amateurishly:* Climbing up mountains. On good days, skiing down them.
- *Contact:* sdemets@uw.edu

# Selected publications:

- **Sydney DeMets**, Emma Spiro. Podcasts in the Periphery: Tracing Guest Trajectories in Political Podcasts *(In Review)*.
